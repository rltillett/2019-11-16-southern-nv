The workshop teaches genomic variant calling methods with Linux command line tools. You don't need to have any previous experience with Linux or the tools presented at the workshop. All learners are encouraged to bring laptops (MacOS, Windows, or Linux), though those from host NSC students will have access to lab computers as well.

Please visit the [official site for the event](https://rltillett.github.io/2019-11-16-southern-nv/) for much more information.

_Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research._

_This workshop is made possible with support from the Nevada INBRE from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM103440) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)._
