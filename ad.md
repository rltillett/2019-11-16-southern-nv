**This workshop is free, but registration is required.** Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. The deadline to register is October 18 at 5 pm, with preference given to the first 40 applicants. Students, faculty and staff from _any institution_ are welcome and encouraged to attend. [Register here.](//unr.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2acmSgFwTSeVnmd)

This workshop focuses on a Variant Calling workflow using Linux command line applications and AWS. You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop, just an interest to learn. All learners are encouraged to bring laptops for this workshop, though those from host NSC students may have access to lab computers, if needed.

Please visit the [official site for the event](https://rltillett.github.io/2019-11-16-southern-nv/) for more information.

Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.

_This workshop is made possible with support from the Nevada INBRE from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM103440) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)._
